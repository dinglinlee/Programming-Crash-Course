# Control Flow

Control Flow is used to determine what code gets executed.

---

## Conditions

Conditions are statements that result in a [boolean](./variables.md#boolean).

!!! Examples
``` python
ans = "the sky red?"
# ans = No
```

## Conditional Statements
### If-Else Statements
If-else are statement in which if the condition is true, the if block code is executed.
For values where condition is false, the else block is executed.
!!! Examples
``` python
ans = 2
if ans>=0:
  return "Yes"
else:
  return "No"
# Output: Yes
```
In this example, 2>0, hence return Yes.

## Loops
### For Loop
For loop goes through a sequence of element one by one, executing the block of code within itself
!!! Examples
``` python
friends = ["alice","bella","charlie"]
for i in friends:
  print (i)
# Output: alice
#         bella
#         charlie
```

### While Loop
While loop executes the block of code within itself as long as the condition holds true
!!! Examples
``` python
number = 5
while number>0: 
  print (number)
  number-=1  # reduces number by one each time, i.e. 5-1=4, 4-1=3, etc
# Output: 5
#         4
#         3
#         2
#         1

```
In this case, as long as number>0, the number gets printed.
At the point where number =0, while loop terminates. 
Hence, the final number printed is 1.
